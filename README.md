# AISamples
Central hub for demos, code snippets, and other assets for Azure Cosmos DB for AI apps. 


## List of stuff

 - Build a Copilot sample app - Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL
    - This sample application shows how to build a Generative-AI application using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL using its new vector search capabilities and Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel. The sample provides practical guidance on many concepts you will need to design and build these types of applications.
    - Azure App Service 
    - C#, Native SDK, Semantic Kernel

- Build your own Copilot End to End Solution Accelerator
    - Production Ready Reference Solution for how to build your own copilot using Azure services including: Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, Azure OpenAI Service, Azure Kubernetes Service or Azure Container Apps. Uses Semantic Kernel plugins for OpenAI, Cosmos DB connectors, and semantic cache. Built in C#.

- Movie ChatBot for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL and Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB
    - In this sample, we'll demonstrate how to build a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pattern application using a subset of the popular Movie Lens 1M dataset. This sample performs RAG over movie data with vector search, stores conversational chat history, and leverages a semantic cache, all using Azure Cosmos DB and its built-in vector search capability. Azure OpenAI Service is used to generate embeddings and LLM completions.

- Cosmic RAG Food app with Langchain, Azure OpenAI and Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore)
    - A Demo application for a streamlined ordering system tailored for various food categories. It allows users to request customized meals, such as "high protein dishes," with recommendations provided from our database. Users can further customize their choices before sending their orders from the app to the restaurant, including delivery details.
